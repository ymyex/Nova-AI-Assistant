**Windows MCP** is a lightweight, open-source project that enables seamless integration between AI agents and the Windows operating system. Acting as an MCP server bridges the gap between LLMs and the Windows operating system, allowing agents to perform tasks such as **file navigation, application control, UI interaction, QA testing,** and more.

mcp-name: io.github.CursorTouch/Windows-MCP

## Updates
- Windows-MCP is now available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/windows-mcp/) (thus supports `uvx`)
- Windows-MCP is added to [MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry)
- Try out 🪟[Windows-Use](https://github.com/CursorTouch/Windows-Use)!!, an agent built using Windows-MCP.
- Windows-MCP is now featured as Desktop Extension in `Claude Desktop`.

### Supported Operating Systems

- Windows 7
- Windows 8, 8.1
- Windows 10
- Windows 11  

## 🎥 Demos

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2b372dc-8d00-4d71-9677-4c64f5987485>

## ✨ Key Features

- **Seamless Windows Integration**  
  Interacts natively with Windows UI elements, opens apps, controls windows, simulates user input, and more.

- **Use Any LLM (Vision Optional)**
   Unlike many automation tools, Windows MCP doesn't rely on any traditional computer vision techniques or specific fine-tuned models; it works with any LLMs, reducing complexity and setup time.

- **Rich Toolset for UI Automation**  
  Includes tools for basic keyboard, mouse operation and capturing window/UI state.

- **Lightweight & Open-Source**  
  Minimal dependencies and easy setup with full source code available under MIT license.

- **Customizable & Extendable**  
  Easily adapt or extend tools to suit your unique automation or AI integration needs.

- **Real-Time Interaction**  
  Typical latency between actions (e.g., from one mouse click to the next) ranges from **0.7 to 2.5 secs**, and may slightly vary based on the number of active applications and system load, also the inferencing speed of the llm.

- **DOM Mode for Browser Automation**  
  Special `use_dom=True` mode for State-Tool that focuses exclusively on web page content, filtering out browser UI elements for cleaner, more efficient web automation.

## 🛠️Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- UV (Package Manager) from Astra, install with `pip install uv` or `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- `English` as the default language in Windows highly preferred or disable the `App-Tool` in the MCP Server for Windows with other languages.
